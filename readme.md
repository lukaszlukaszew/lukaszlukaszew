## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m @lukaszlukaszew, self-taught developer and database enthusiast

  
#### :memo: 1. Iâ€™m currently working onâ€¦

###### Computer Games Management App
I love creating lists and notes, which, combined with the fact that computer games consumed quite a lot of my time in the past, made me create a database in which I store everything about games that I would like to remember. For example: information about a given title, on which platform I have a copy, what difficulty levels have I completed, and so onâ€¦ all this trouble to remeber that there are other games than the Batman: Arkham series :grin:
At this point Iâ€™m creating a GUI (Python, PyQT, T-SQL ) to make this database easier to handle.

###### ToDo App
Once I deal with the above, I will go a step further: I will create an application that supports many users, my plan include: Windows client, Android client and Web-Browser client. All that nicely cooperating with the elegant database server.

#### :books: 2. Iâ€™m currently learningâ€¦

Definitely Python! Now I'm studying PyQT and Python Standard Library, next will be Django. I am also improving my knowledge of T-SQL. Recently, I have also been learning Git and Gitub possibilities.

In addition to all mentioned tools, I train my understanding of OOP and expand my knowledge of algorithms.

#### :microscope: 3. Iâ€™m interested inâ€¦

- Solving Programming problems (I'm using Kattis at the moment!).
- computer games developement - I have a few ideas of my own and I want to implement at least some of them in the near future,
- learning about libraries: pandas, matplotlib, opencv, unittest, multithreading, asyncio, pygame,
- mathematics, process design, logistics.

#### :card_file_box: 4. My experience...

My professional career so far, from the point of view of technology, has included:
- reporting in the fields like logistics and finance using MS Excel & T-SQL,
- design, testing and maintenance of logistics processes and business applications (WMS & ERP) in a nationwide network of electronics stores.

#### :wrench: 5. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate onâ€¦

â€¦ basically everything related to the above-mentioned tools. Everything I have done so far as a programmer is my own job, so I would love to be able to create something bigger together with someone from whom I could learn new things, and also how to do something better and faster.
